thank you yeah so this is a code for general knowledge proof right but you have this like so data submission by user user inputs attendance and this is done as well right okay so we have this called summer as well which one 1.1 yes I think this is the one I did in the beginning and I show about this two lines receive the date and generate your nose proof using like right so yes I guess you know because there is the user and there is this like a tendons you can generate the proof Anderson I mean so so yeah so flask so I think there should be one thing from the flask here you just will be exposed by the Raspberry Pi I guess rights and HTTP server and then roofing right because it's so great as I said how do you create a message oh because you're creating empty public key and empty signature send a message signed by the public private key and now you have this message and you want to prove something to someone but you don't want to give the message and then you can generate this code and you see that yeah in 147 and this proof you can give to someone say there is this another maybe you can create another flat instance that will be like the attendance verifier where you can submit the pro and then this attendance verifier will just use this graph 35 verifier is the full visa verifier just like someone to whom so it's going to be like a separate entity and it's just someone you want to give your proof and it can verify that you indeed it can be difficult when you run can you try running it is there some problems 127 can you show the first okay scroll scroll scroll actually can you can you can you get a paper up can you give arrow up basically I mean you know we can also have just like a small thing where you submit because scroll down with your code Toyota sprint props in in line 14150 150 your exporting a contract right so I can put it into the into the blockchain this contract will have will have some functions and it will be like also like play verified proof and you can submit those numbers that will be printed to the smart contract and they will be able to submit to blockchain and check whether you're profits correct and that's it does it make sense I know that's maybe a lot of information to process so I need to I don't need to like make it hush hash data and resistant blockchain at the Beginning but because in a rent a car to generate the proofs and this proof you can give to someone and they will be able to check it against the smart contractor check where it's correct yeah how are you with your report I wrote outline so I was thinking of sending you outline and check outline and after that I want I start writing essay if you can do it also as soon as possible that be the ticket can I send it today like the outline of my you can send it whatever you want I'm just like I'm not sure I'll be able to you know look at it today call corrected but you did something else already it's like SMS I will send you a Google drive Link incorporate for the signature if you struggle to struggle just let me know it can be on teams a message to now I'll try to provide you with some additional thank you code and floor is ok and yeah so this was my personal project not this dissertation spot I was making some sweet I want AI chatbot and I wanted to make truck eye tracking track what I will leave London so it it will be hard to come to university after October so I wanted to answer find 3D printing is too expensive so I wanted to do this 3D printing it is related to the dissertation yeah yeah yeah so you may be you know if you you should have like a program director maybe they will be able to do it summary of this meeting to avoid misunderstanding so if I have any mistakes could you tell me yeah of course thank you so much no worries and thank you bye have a nice day bye
